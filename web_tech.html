  <h1>
    The evolution of Internet, from the beginning to web 4.0
  </h1>
  <p>
    The Internet age has known many definitions. At the beginning there was what we call now web 1.0, back then simply named as web. Were developed the first websites, portals and online services and users could only read the information, without the chance of a direct interaction. It was the web of one-way communication.

Then arrives the web 2.0, with the emergence and proliferation of social networks and all the applications as blogs, forums and podcasts, that made possible new forms of participative communication. Indeed, because of the development of these new instruments, users started to communicate among them and share contents through the web, helping to generate the content itself. From a passive actor the user becomes the lead in the creation and management of online contents, by building new processes and dynamics in what we can also call collaborative web.

        <h2>
           And web 4.0?
           </h2>
      
 <p>
         Recently they have been talking about web 4.0, with the related future predictions. Surely in the next stage of web technologies of augmented reality and Big data will have a main role. It is suspected that it will be an age in which each person will have a digital alter ego and will talk more and more with new interfaces, like intelligent machines. Thereâ€™s also a pretty dystopian vision of the web in the future, with a greater control of the information that will affect not only the digital world but also the reality around us.
